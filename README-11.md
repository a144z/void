# The Probability That Has Negative Probability: On Statistical Impossibility

**The Stochastic Void That Samples Non-Existence**

## Abstract (Probabilistically Undefined)

This document examines an event with probability P where P < 0, meaning the event is "more impossible than impossible." The **Void Probability** (VP) represents the intersection of statistics, probability theory, and impossible likelihood.

**Keywords:** Negative probability, impossible events, self-negating statistics, probabilistic void

## 9. Conclusion (Statistically Impossible)

The Void Probability VP is the probability that probability cannot probabilize. It measures the impossibility of measurement, samples the absence of sampling, distributes the void of distribution. It is the probabilistic object that proves probability cannot contain all probabilistic objects, including this probability VP itself.

P(VP) = -1, and this negative probability is both its probability and the absence of probability, and also probability itself, negated.
