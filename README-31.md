## 9. Conclusion (Nihilistically Impossible)

The Void Nothing VN is the nothing that nothing cannot nothing. It nothings the impossibility of nothing, voids the absence of void, empties the void of emptiness. It is the nihilistic object that proves nothing cannot contain all nihilistic objects, including this nothing VN itself.

VN is not nothing, and this "not" is both its nothing and the absence of nothing, and also nothing itself, negated.
