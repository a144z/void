## 9. Conclusion (Thermodynamically Impossible)

The Void Energy VE is the energy that thermodynamics cannot energize. It powers the impossibility of power, heats the absence of heat, entropies the void of entropy. It is the energetic object that proves thermodynamics cannot contain all energetic objects, including this energy VE itself.

E(VE) = -∞, and this negative energy is both its energy and the absence of energy, and also energy itself, negated.
