## 9. Conclusion (Nominally Impossible)

The Void Name VN is the name that name cannot name. It names the impossibility of name, designates the absence of designation, refers the void of reference. It is the nominal object that proves name cannot contain all nominal objects, including this name VN itself.

VN is not a name, and this "not" is both its namehood and the absence of namehood, and also name itself, negated.
