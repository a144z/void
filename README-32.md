## Abstract (Universally Undefined)

This document describes a universal U that cannot be universal because it excludes itself. The **Void Universal** (VU) represents the intersection of logic, metaphysics, and universal paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative universal, impossible totality, self-excluding whole, universal void

## 9. Conclusion (Universally Impossible)

The Void Universal VU is the universal that universal cannot universal. It universals the impossibility of universal, includes the absence of inclusion, totals the void of totality. It is the universal object that proves universal cannot contain all universal objects, including this universal VU itself.

VU is not all, and this "not" is both its universality and the absence of universality, and also universal itself, negated.
