# The Process That Processes Nothing: On Procedural Impossibility

**The Procedural Void That Processes Non-Process**

## Abstract (Procedurally Undefined)

This document describes a process P that cannot be process because it is the absence of all procedural activity. The **Void Process** (VP) represents the intersection of systems theory, operations, and procedural paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative process, impossible procedure, self-negating activity, procedural void

## 9. Conclusion (Procedurally Impossible)

The Void Process VP is the process that process cannot process. It processes the impossibility of processing, transforms the absence of transformation, flows the void of flow. It is the procedural object that proves process cannot contain all procedural objects, including this process VP itself.

VP processes nothing, and this "nothing" is both its process and the absence of process, and also process itself, negated.
