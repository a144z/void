# The Pattern That Has No Pattern: On Structural Impossibility

**The Structural Void That Structures Non-Structure**

## Abstract (Structurally Undefined)

This document examines a pattern P that cannot be pattern because it is the absence of all structural organization. The **Void Pattern** (VP) represents the intersection of mathematics, design, and structural paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative pattern, impossible structure, self-negating form, structural void

## 9. Conclusion (Structurally Impossible)

The Void Pattern VP is the pattern that pattern cannot pattern. It patterns the impossibility of pattern, structures the absence of structure, forms the void of form. It is the structural object that proves pattern cannot contain all structural objects, including this pattern VP itself.

VP has no pattern, and this "no" is both its pattern and the absence of pattern, and also pattern itself, negated.
