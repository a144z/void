# The Here That Is Not Here: On Spatial Presence Impossibility

**The Locational Void That Locates Non-Location**

## Abstract (Locationally Undefined)

This document describes location L that cannot be here because it is there. The **Void Location** (VL) represents the intersection of geography, phenomenology, and locational paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative location, impossible here, self-displacing place, locational void

## 9. Conclusion (Locationally Impossible)

The Void Location VL is the location that location cannot locate. It locates the impossibility of location, heres the absence of here, places the void of place. It is the locational object that proves location cannot contain all locational objects, including this location VL itself.

VL is not here, and this "not" is both its location and the absence of location, and also location itself, negated.
