# The Possible That Is Not Possible: On Possibility Impossibility

**The Possible Void That Possibilities Non-Possibility**

## Abstract (Possibly Undefined)

This document describes possibility P that cannot be possible because it is impossible. The **Void Possibility** (VP) represents the intersection of modal logic, metaphysics, and possibility paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative possibility, impossible possibility, self-impossibilizing possible, possibility void

## 9. Conclusion (Possibly Impossible)

The Void Possibility VP is the possibility that possibility cannot possible. It possibilities the impossibility of possibility, cans the absence of can, ables the void of ability. It is the possibility object that proves possibility cannot contain all possibility objects, including this possibility VP itself.

VP is not possible, and this "not" is both its possibility and the absence of possibility, and also possibility itself, negated.
