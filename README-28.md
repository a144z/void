# The Choice That Cannot Be Chosen: On Decisional Impossibility

**The Decisional Void That Chooses Non-Choice**

## Abstract (Decisionally Undefined)

This document describes a choice C that cannot be choice because it is the absence of all decisional capacity. The **Void Choice** (VC) represents the intersection of decision theory, philosophy, and decisional paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative choice, impossible decision, self-negating selection, decisional void

## 9. Conclusion (Decisionally Impossible)

The Void Choice VC is the choice that choice cannot choose. It chooses the impossibility of choice, decides the absence of decision, selects the void of selection. It is the decisional object that proves choice cannot contain all decisional objects, including this choice VC itself.

VC cannot be chosen, and this "cannot" is both its choice and the absence of choice, and also choice itself, negated.
