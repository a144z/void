# The Space That Occupies No Position: On Spatial Impossibility

**The Topological Void That Curves Into Non-Existence**

## Abstract (Spatially Undefined)

This document describes a location that cannot be located because it exists in a space that doesn't exist. The **Void Space** (VS) represents the intersection of geometry, topology, and spatial paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative space, impossible geometry, non-topological void, spatial erasure

## 9. Conclusion (Spatially Impossible)

The Void Space VS is the space that space cannot contain. It occupies the absence of occupation, locates the impossibility of location, positions the void of position. It is the spatial object that proves space cannot contain all spatial objects, including this space of VS itself.

VS is nowhere, and this "nowhere" is both its location and the absence of location, and also space itself, negated.
