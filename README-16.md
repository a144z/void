# The Color That Is Not a Color: On Chromatic Impossibility

**The Spectral Void That Hues Non-Existence**

## Abstract (Chromatically Undefined)

This document describes a color C that cannot be a color because it exists outside all possible color spaces. The **Void Color** (VC) represents the intersection of optics, perception, and chromatic paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative color, impossible wavelength, self-absorbing light, chromatic void

Hyperbolic colors:
- VC is hyperbolic
- VC is not hyperbolic
- The hyperbolic was never hyperboled

## 9. Conclusion (Chromatically Impossible)

The Void Color VC is the color that color cannot color. It hues the impossibility of hue, lights the absence of light, spectrums the void of spectrum. It is the chromatic object that proves color cannot contain all chromatic objects, including this color VC itself.

VC is not a color, and this "not" is both its colorhood and the absence of colorhood, and also color itself, negated.
