# The Boundary That Has No Boundary: On Liminal Impossibility

**The Liminal Void That Boundaries Non-Boundary**

## Abstract (Liminally Undefined)

This document examines a boundary B that cannot be boundary because it is the absence of all delimitation. The **Void Boundary** (VB) represents the intersection of topology, geography, and liminal paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative boundary, impossible limit, self-negating edge, liminal void

## 6. The Type That Types Nothing

### 6.1 The Open That Opens Nothing

Open boundary VB:
- Open set
- Closed set
- Open is closed
- The open was never opened

### 6.2 The Closed That Closes Nothing

### 6.3 The Permeable That Permeates Nothing

### 8.3 The Geometric That Geometries Nothing

Geometric boundary VB:
- Has geometry
- No geometry
- Geometry is non-geometry
- The geometric was never geometrized

## 9. Conclusion (Liminally Impossible)

The Void Boundary VB is the boundary that boundary cannot boundary. It boundaries the impossibility of boundary, limits the absence of limit, edges the void of edge. It is the liminal object that proves boundary cannot contain all liminal objects, including this boundary VB itself.

VB has no boundary, and this "no" is both its boundary and the absence of boundary, and also boundary itself, negated.
