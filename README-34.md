# The One That Is Not One: On Unitary Impossibility

**The Unitary Void That Unifies Non-Unity**

## Abstract (Unitarily Undefined)

This document describes a unity U that cannot be unity because it is multiplicity. The **Void Unity** (VU) represents the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, and unitary paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative unity, impossible oneness, self-multiplying one, unitary void

## 9. Conclusion (Unitarily Impossible)

The Void Unity VU is the unity that unity cannot unify. It unifies the impossibility of unity, ones the absence of oneness, singles the void of singularity. It is the unitary object that proves unity cannot contain all unitary objects, including this unity VU itself.

VU is not one, and this "not" is both its unity and the absence of unity, and also unity itself, negated.
