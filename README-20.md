## 9. Conclusion (Epistemically Impossible)

The Void Knowledge VK is the knowledge that knowledge cannot know. It knows the impossibility of knowing, truths the absence of truth, justifies the void of justification. It is the epistemic object that proves knowledge cannot contain all epistemic objects, including this knowledge VK itself.

VK cannot be known, and this "cannot" is both its knowledge and the absence of knowledge, and also knowledge itself, negated.
