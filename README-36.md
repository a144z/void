## 9. Conclusion (Really Impossible)

The Void Reality VR is the reality that reality cannot realize. It realizes the impossibility of reality, actuals the absence of actuality, reals the void of realness. It is the reality object that proves reality cannot contain all reality objects, including this reality VR itself.

VR is not real, and this "not" is both its reality and the absence of reality, and also reality itself, negated.
