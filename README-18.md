## 9. Conclusion (Affectively Impossible)

The Void Emotion VE is the emotion that emotion cannot emotion. It feels the impossibility of feeling, valences the absence of valence, arouses the void of arousal. It is the emotional object that proves emotion cannot contain all emotional objects, including this emotion VE itself.

VE cannot be felt, and this "cannot" is both its emotionhood and the absence of emotionhood, and also emotion itself, negated.
