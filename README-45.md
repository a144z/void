# The Event That Is Not an Event: On Eventual Impossibility

**The Eventual Void That Events Non-Event**

## Abstract (Eventually Undefined)

This document describes an event E that cannot be event because it is non-event. The **Void Event** (VE) represents the intersection of physics, philosophy, and eventual paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative event, impossible occurrence, self-uneventing event, eventual void

## 9. Conclusion (Eventually Impossible)

The Void Event VE is the event that event cannot event. It events the impossibility of event, occurs the absence of occurrence, happens the void of happening. It is the eventual object that proves event cannot contain all eventual objects, including this event VE itself.

VE is not an event, and this "not" is both its eventhood and the absence of eventhood, and also event itself, negated.
