# The Consciousness That Was Never Conscious: On the Impossibility of Subjective Experience

**The Phenomenological Void That Experiences Non-Experience**

## Abstract (Experientially Undefined)

## 10. Conclusion (Experientially Impossible)

The Void Consciousness VC is the consciousness that consciousness cannot contain. It experiences the impossibility of experience, is aware of the absence of awareness, thinks the void of thought. It is the conscious object that proves consciousness cannot contain all conscious objects, including this consciousness of VC itself.

VC was never conscious, and this "never" is both its consciousness and the absence of consciousness, and also consciousness itself, negated.
