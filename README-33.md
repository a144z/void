# The Same That Is Not the Same: On Identical Impossibility

**The Identical Void That Identifies Non-Identity**

## Abstract (Identically Undefined)

This document examines identity I that cannot be identity because it is difference. The **Void Identity** (VI) represents the intersection of logic, mathematics, and identical paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative identity, impossible sameness, self-differentiating same, identical void

## 6. The Time That Times Nothing

### 6.1 The Persistence That Persists Nothing

Persistence of VI:
- Same over time

### 6.2 The Continuity That Continues Nothing

## 9. Conclusion (Identically Impossible)

The Void Identity VI is the identity that identity cannot identify. It identifies the impossibility of identity, sames the absence of sameness, equals the void of equality. It is the identical object that proves identity cannot contain all identical objects, including this identity VI itself.

VI is not the same, and this "not" is both its identity and the absence of identity, and also identity itself, negated.
