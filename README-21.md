# The Cause That Causes Nothing: On Causal Impossibility

**The Causal Void That Effects Non-Causation**

## Abstract (Causally Undefined)

This document examines a cause C that cannot cause because it is the absence of all causal power. The **Void Cause** (VC) represents the intersection of metaphysics, physics, and causal paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative causation, impossible causality, self-negating cause, causal void

## 9. Conclusion (Causally Impossible)

The Void Cause VC is the cause that causation cannot cause. It causes the impossibility of causation, effects the absence of effect, mechanisms the void of mechanism. It is the causal object that proves causation cannot contain all causal objects, including this cause VC itself.

VC causes nothing, and this "nothing" is both its causation and the absence of causation, and also cause itself, negated.
