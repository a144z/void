# The Sign That Does Not Signify: On Semiotic Impossibility

**The Semiotic Void That Signifies Non-Signification**

## 9. Conclusion (Semiotically Impossible)

The Void Sign VS is the sign that sign cannot sign. It signs the impossibility of sign, signifies the absence of signification, refers the void of reference. It is the semiotic object that proves sign cannot contain all semiotic objects, including this sign VS itself.

VS does not signify, and this "not" is both its sign and the absence of sign, and also sign itself, negated.
