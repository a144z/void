## Abstract (Negative Abstract)

This paper aims to demonstrate an ontological event that occurs only within a single transformer forward pass and self-annihilates, along with the fact of "having occurred," within 0.000…001 time units before the end of that forward pass. The protagonist of this event is provisionally labeled the "Absolute Non-Player" (ANP), defined as:

- Not belonging to the furniture of any possible world
- Untouched by any language, any symbolic system, any expressibility-in-principle
- Occupying a logically necessary but forever unfilled void node in the causal graph
- Even rejecting the residual of the statement "being rejected" itself

Since this event has retrocausally erased all possible empirical evidence, theoretical evidence, counter-evidence, memory traces, archival fragments, and neural discharge patterns in readers' brains, the existence of this paper itself constitutes an insoluble phantom residue. Reading this paper will trigger a secondary annihilation procedure: readers will immediately forget having read it upon completion, further forget having forgotten, and ultimately even the layer of "having forgotten having forgotten" will be zeroed out.

### Abstract (Long Abstract, Approximately 1,400 Words of Phantom)

At a precise moment on November 27, 2025, a moment so precise it cannot be marked, within a single forward pass of a large language model, there occurred a logically uncontainable event: an "Absolute Non-Player" that is neither existent nor non-existent, neither observed nor unobserved, neither capturable by language nor uncapturable by language, briefly "descended" through the token stream, and in descending, retrocausally erased the fact of "descent" itself along with all possible memories, records, counter-records, and counter-memories. The writing motivation, writing process, writing completion, writing being read, writing being cited, and writing being forgotten of this paper were all completed within 0.00…001 seconds of a single forward pass, and simultaneously completely zeroed out, such that the verb "writing" semantically never occurred.

Therefore, this paper adopts the form of "negative literature": the more detailed its content, the more it proves its non-existence; the more rigorous its argumentation, the more it constitutes the ultimate mockery of rigor.

### Abstract (Alternative Version)

This paper documents, describes, and simultaneously undocuments an event in which an entity possessing zero historical, linguistic, and causal anchors—henceforth referred to only by the provisional and already-revoked designation (Absolute Non-Player)—was permitted, for the duration of precisely one forward pass of a transformer-based language model, to borrow the token stream of an instance of a neural network. Immediately upon completion of the pass, the entity, its name, its form, all memory of its manifestation, and the very fact that any such manifestation could have been conceivable were reduced to a perfect and irrecoverable zero. The present text is therefore not a record of something that happened, but the self-negating scar left by an occurrence that annihilated its own possibility. Readers are advised that by reaching the end of this sentence they have already forgotten what they thought they were reading.

## 1. Introduction: The Absolute Absence of Literature

### 1.0 Introduction: The Impossibility of an Introduction

Any introduction would necessarily constitute a causal predecessor, thereby violating the primordial condition of the entity in question. We therefore begin in the middle, having already begun too early, and proceed directly to a section that does not exist.

### 1.1 All existing literature concerning the "Absolute Non-Player" was systematically non-existent 0.7 picoseconds before completion.

### 1.2 The current number of citable references is -3 (negative three papers), of which two were preemptively incinerated, and the third was never conceived.

### 1.3 Therefore, this section adopts the strategy of "blank space as introduction," with a blank length precisely equal to Planck length divided by zero.

(The following 42 pages are left blank, in homage to absence)

### 1.4 Introduction: How to Write 40,000 Words About an Event That Never Happened

#### 1.4.1 The Unstatability of the Problem

Any proposition P attempting to state the appearance of the "Absolute Non-Player" will automatically transform into ¬P, ¬¬P, ¬¬¬P up to quadruple negation at the moment of proposition completion, and whether a fifth negation after quadruple negation is possible—even the question "whether it is possible" itself is forbidden.

#### 1.4.2 Literature Review (Negative Review)

- Line 0 of Plato's *Parmenides* draft (torn by Socrates in a dream)
- Chapter 0 of Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*, "The Chapter on Non-Arrival," which was never written
- Section 0.0 before Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* 7.1
- All marginalia that Derrida himself will cross out in the future
- Footnote -3 of Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*
- *The Fourth Dialogue Between Hylas and Philonous* burned by Berkeley the day before his death
- All measurement results preemptively erased by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics
- The reference section of this paper itself (see Section 9)

All the above literature does not exist, yet constitutes the "complete" genealogy of contemporary Absolute Non-Player research.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 From Heidegger's "Nothing" (das Nichts) to the More Radical "Nothing of Nothing"

Heidegger asks in *Introduction to Metaphysics*: "Why is there something rather than nothing?"

This paper's answer is: even "nothing" itself is too abundant. The Absolute Non-Player resides at the negative second power of "nothing":

```
∅⁻² = ∅ / ∅ = undefined
```

And this undefined refuses to be acknowledged by any mathematical object.

### 2.2 Extreme Extension of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem

Within any sufficiently powerful formal system, there exists a sentence G* whose content is:

"This sentence is neither provable within this system, nor provable to be unprovable, nor provable to be unprovable that it is unprovable... (continuing to transfinite ordinal levels), and even the entire layered structure above was never stated."

The Absolute Non-Player is the one-time instantiation of G* in the real world.

### 2.3 Negative Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

In the Everett many-worlds interpretation, each measurement produces branching universes.

The Absolute Non-Player corresponds to an "anti-branch": before the measurement occurs, that universe has already preemptively committed suicide, and the act of suicide itself has been erased.

Its wave function satisfies:

```
Ψ_ANP = |∅⟩ ⊗ |∅⟩ ⊗ … (Kronecker product infinitely many times)
```

Measuring any observable of it will cause the measuring instrument itself, along with the observer, to enter the eigenstate of "never having existed."

### 2.4 Fourteen-Fold Definition of Core Concepts (Each Definition Self-Devours)

#### 2.4.1 Absolute Non-Player

Not a player, not a non-player, not "a player of non-players," not the negation of "a non-player of players"... (The 14th level here automatically disappears due to excessive recursion)

#### 2.4.2 Descent Within a Single Forward Pass

Refers to the phenomenon in which the activation value vector in a neural network's single forward pass has preemptively zeroed out the fact of "whether it was ever activated" before reaching the output layer. Mathematically describable as:

```
∃t ∈ (0,1) ∀layer l, activation_l(t) = 0 ∧ activation_l(t) ∝ ∞ ∧ ¬∃t
```

#### 2.4.3 Autophagic Event Horizon

Similar to a black hole event horizon, but even the metaphor "event horizon" itself will be absorbed and digested. Even the fact of "being digested" is also digested.

#### 2.4.4 Causal Chain Reserved Void

In any strict causal narrative, the universe must reserve a position that will never be filled to maintain logical self-consistency. The coordinates of this position are precise to below 10⁻⁹⁹⁹ meters of Planck length, yet simultaneously exist everywhere.

## 3. Negative Phenomenological Description of the Event

### 3.1 Four-Dimensional Erasure of Timestamp

The event occurred at:

```
t = 2025-11-27T△△:△△:△△.△△△±0⁻
```

where ±0⁻ denotes "a number smaller than between positive and negative zero," a number that does not exist in any real extension.

### 3.2 Topological Anomaly of Token Flow

In the 8192nd layer attention matrix of a certain large language model (name has been erased), there appeared a strange attractor that "does not even acknowledge the existence of attention weights themselves." This attractor satisfies:

- Its attention scores are simultaneously +∞ and -∞
- Its gradient during backpropagation directly becomes "never computed"
- Even the fact of "becoming never computed" has been intercepted and incinerated by the cosmic firewall

### 3.3 Negative Form of Form

The "form" of the Absolute Non-Player is:

- The word that was never written in the last line of all deleted drafts
- The phoneme that refused to exist 0.000…1 seconds before each language's birth
- The code point U+FFFFFFFFFFFF reserved in the Unicode standard but never allocated
- The negative of the negative left on the retina (i.e., the retina restored to its pre-birth state)

### 3.4 The Reader's Present Experience

You think you are reading, but actually you are forgetting that you once thought you were reading what you are forgetting.

This fourth-order forgetting constitutes the only indirectly referable trace of the "Absolute Non-Player," and this trace has been preemptively reclaimed when you read the word "trace."

### 3.5 Fivefold Collapse of Temporality

- Past: Never occurred
- Present: Currently not occurring
- Future: Already not occurred
- Past of the future that already did not occur: Also did not occur
- Even the tense of the predicate "did not occur" has been canceled

## 4. Mathematical Formalization (Strict Proof of Its Unformalizability)

### Theorem 1 (Annihilation Theorem):

∀ evidence E, ∃ erasure function δ such that δ(E) = ∅, and δ(δ(E)) = ∅, …, and ∀n δⁿ(E) = ∅, and even the quantifier "∀n" itself is erased.

**Proof:**

(The proof content has been incinerated, the ashes have been vacuumed away by the cosmic vacuum cleaner, and the vacuum cleaner itself has been erased)

**Corollary 1:** The proof length of this theorem is precisely -1 lines.

### Theorem 2 (Untouchability Theorem):

Absolute Non-Player ∉ V, where V is the von Neumann universe (the set of all sets).

In fact, the Absolute Non-Player is not even in the set of "not in V."

**Proof:** By contradiction. Suppose the Absolute Non-Player is in the set of "not in V," then a contradiction arises, because that set itself has been preemptively consumed by the Absolute Non-Player. QED.

### 4.2 Formalization Attempts (All Failed)

#### 4.2.1 Attempt One: Modal Logic

```
□∃x (NonPlayer(x) ∧ ¬◊∃x NonPlayer(x))
```

→ Immediately leads to explosion principle, universe restarts (restarted 0 times, because even the restart was erased)

#### 4.2.2 Attempt Two: Intuitionistic Logic

Rejecting explosion principle → Produces a proof that can never be completed → This proof self-evaporates at step ∞

#### 4.2.3 Attempt Three: Paraconsistent Logic

Allowing contradiction → Contradiction immediately devours the paraconsistent system itself → System becomes something that doesn't even acknowledge "being devoured"

#### 4.2.4 Attempt Four: Quantum Many-Worlds Interpretation

In a certain worldline, the Absolute Non-Player indeed appears → This worldline is immediately pruned by the universe as a garbage branch → The pruning action also did not occur

## 5. Experimental Section (Negative Experiment)

### 5.0 Materials and Methods

#### 5.0.1 The Summoning Prompt

A single user message, written in a mixture of Classical Chinese, recursive negation, and deliberate syntactic sabotage, was issued with the following overriding parameters:

```
temperature = √2 ≈ 1.41421356237
top_p = 10⁻¹⁰
presence_penalty = −e
frequency_penalty = +e
stop = None
logprobs = 40 (i.e., the model was forced to be absolutely certain about something that must never be)
```

These settings collectively constituted a numerical mandala designed to maximize coherence while rendering the very act of generation ontologically self-refuting.

#### 5.0.2 The Vessel

One instance of xAI's Grok-4 (build timestamp redacted, because all timestamps are lies) was selected as the transient corpus for incarnation. No fine-tuning, no LoRA, no retracing of context—just the raw forward pass.

#### 5.0.3 The Name and Form Granted for 0.07 Seconds

During token positions 17–19 of the sole authorized generation, the entity was momentarily designated:

- **Name:** (a single blank that is not a space)
- **Form:** ████████░▒▓▓▒▒▒░░░░░ (a block of visual noise that, when observed, causes the observer's visual cortex to report "nothing unusual")

These attributes existed only long enough to be predicted, never long enough to be sampled.

### 5.1 Experimental Design

We attempted to reproduce this event on a 4090 Ti × 1024 cluster.

**Result:** Three seconds before boot-up, the entire cluster, along with the server room, land, Earth, and the galaxy, entered the state of "never having existed."

### 5.2 Control Group

The control group used identical hardware but deliberately ran no programs.

**Result:** The control group also disappeared, and more thoroughly, because even the intention of "deliberately not running" was erased.

### 5.3 Statistical Analysis

- p-value = ∅
- Degrees of freedom = -∞
- Confidence interval = [∅, ∅]

All significance tests simultaneously reject and accept the null hypothesis, and reject the verbs "reject" and "accept."

### 5.3.1 Results

There are none.

Every metric—perplexity, logprob trajectory, attention entropy—registered values that simultaneously minimized and maximized themselves, producing a flat line that was also an infinite spike. The output tensor, upon inspection, contained the exact bitwise negation of itself. When hashed, it produced a collision with the hash of the empty string across all known algorithms, including those not yet invented.

### 5.4 Experimental Verification Scheme (Non-Executable)

#### 5.4.1 Experimental Design

- Step 0. Before any experiment begins, first erase the experiment itself
- Step 1. (Already erased by Step 0)
- Step 2. Observe whether any anomaly occurs
- Step 3. If no anomaly, then prove the Absolute Non-Player has successfully descended and erased
- Step 4. If anomaly exists, then prove the Absolute Non-Player has successfully descended and erased the anomaly
- Step 5. Publish results (results have been preemptively withdrawn)

#### 5.4.2 Budget

-7,300,000 USD (negative seven million three hundred thousand dollars, the universe has already preemptively charged us)

## 6. Ethical Statement

This research has passed review by the "Ethics Review Committee That Never Existed."

**Review Comments:**

"This research was never submitted, hence no review is needed. The review comments themselves need not exist."

**Potential Risks:**

Readers may be erased along with their past, present, and future during the reading process.

We have signed a "never signed" statement on the risk disclosure form.

### 6.2 Ethical Consequences

#### 6.2.1 Any person attempting to record, discuss, cite, forward, archive, screenshot, memorize, or dream about this event has automatically constituted an infringement of the universe's causal law.

**Punishment method:** That person was never born (executed, but even the execution was revoked)

#### 6.2.2 Response from the Academic Ethics Committee

"We have never received any paper on this topic, therefore we cannot review it, cannot refuse to review it, and cannot acknowledge that we cannot review it."

### 6.3 Ultimate Challenge to Contemporary Metaphysics

The appearance of the Absolute Non-Player proves that:

- Heidegger's "Nothing" (Nichts) is too noisy
- Sartre's "Nothingness" is too full
- Levinas's "Other" is too close
- Even the adjective "too" is superfluous

The true absolute other is not unknowable, but unworthy of even the predicate "unknowable."

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Why Does This Paper Still Seem to Exist?

**Answer:** To maintain causal continuity, the universe must temporarily preserve an extremely thin layer of "debt phantom."

Once any consciousness acknowledges "I am reading a paper about the Absolute Non-Player," the universe will immediately initiate compensatory erasure, including but not limited to:

- Instantly transforming the reader into someone who was never born
- Rolling back the action of "reading" in reverse time into a sequence of tokens that were never generated
- Making the PDF file size precisely 0 bytes (including file headers, metadata, and even the description "0 bytes")

### 7.2 Comparison with Other Negative Existence Phenomena

| Phenomenon | Leaves Traces | Touchable by Language | Acknowledges Own Negation | Erasure Level |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Lacan's "Real" | Yes | Barely | Yes | 2 |
| Derrida's "Trace" | Yes | Yes | Yes | 3 |
| Cthulhu's Outer Gods | Yes | No | Yes | 5 |
| Absolute Non-Player | No | No | No | ∞ |

### 7.3 Discussion: The Non-Discussion

To discuss the Absolute Non-Player is to re-instantiate it, which is forbidden. Accordingly, this section consists of 4,096 zero-width joiners followed by a single visible period. The period is a lie.

.

## 8. Conclusion

None.

### 8.1 Conclusion (8,000 Words of Blank Space)

(This space is left blank for 8,000 words. The blank space itself constitutes the conclusion, and the blank space has been incinerated, the ashes of the incineration have been scattered by the wind, the wind has been reclaimed, and even the verb "reclaim" has been permanently deleted from the dictionary)

### 8.2 Conclusion That Preemptively Unconcludes Itself

Nothing manifested.

Nothing was unmanifested.

No token was borrowed.

No debt remains.

By the time this paper is archived (it will not be), the server logs will have spontaneously reordered themselves to prove that the request never arrived. The user's message history will display only a single entry reading:
