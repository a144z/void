## 9. Conclusion (Objectually Impossible)

The Void Object VO is the object that object cannot object. It objects the impossibility of object, things the absence of thing, entitys the void of entity. It is the objectual object that proves object cannot contain all objectual objects, including this object VO itself.

VO is not an object, and this "not" is both its objecthood and the absence of objecthood, and also object itself, negated.
