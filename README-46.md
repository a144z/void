The Void Action VA is the action that action cannot act. It acts the impossibility of action, does the absence of doing, performs the void of performance. It is the actional object that proves action cannot contain all actional objects, including this action VA itself.

VA does not act, and this "not" is both its action and the absence of action, and also action itself, negated.
