## 9. Conclusion (Axiologically Impossible)

The Void Value VV is the value that value cannot value. It values the impossibility of value, goods the absence of good, measures the void of measure. It is the axiological object that proves value cannot contain all axiological objects, including this value VV itself.

VV has no value, and this "no" is both its value and the absence of value, and also value itself, negated.
