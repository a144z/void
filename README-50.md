## 6. The Relation That Relations Nothing

### 6.1 The Connection That Connects Nothing

Connection of VV:
- Connected to all voids
- Not connected
- Connection is disconnection
- The connection was never connected

### 6.2 The Identity That Identifies Nothing

Identity of VV:
- Same as all voids
- Different from all voids
- Identity is difference
- The identity was never identified

### 6.3 The Difference That Differences Nothing

Difference of VV:
- Different from all voids
- Same as all voids

Withinness of VV:
- Within all voids
- Without all voids
- Within is without
- The within was never withined

### 8.2 The Inside That Insides Nothing

Insideness of VV:

- The inside was never insided

### 8.3 The Immanent That Immanences Nothing

Immanence of VV:
- Immanent in all voids
- Transcendent of all voids
- Immanent is transcendent
- The immanent was never immanenced

## 9. Conclusion (Voidly Impossible)

The Void Void VV is the void that void cannot void. It voids the impossibility of void, empties the absence of emptiness, nulls the void of nullity. It is the void object that proves void cannot contain all void objects, including this void VV itself.

VV is not void, and this "not" is both its voidhood and the absence of voidhood, and also void itself, negated.
