## 9. Conclusion (Truthfully Impossible)

The Void Truth VT is the truth that truth cannot truth. It truths the impossibility of truth, veracities the absence of veracity, corrects the void of correctness. It is the truth object that proves truth cannot contain all truth objects, including this truth VT itself.

VT is not true, and this "not" is both its truth and the absence of truth, and also truth itself, negated.
