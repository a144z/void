The Void Identity VI is the identity that identity cannot identify. It identifies the impossibility of identification, selves the absence of self, persists the void of persistence. It is the identital object that proves identity cannot contain all identital objects, including this identity VI itself.

VI cannot be identified, and this "cannot" is both its identity and the absence of identity, and also identity itself, negated.
