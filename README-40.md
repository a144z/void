The Void Presence VP is the presence that presence cannot present. It presents the impossibility of presence, nows the absence of now, currents the void of currency. It is the presence object that proves presence cannot contain all presence objects, including this presence VP itself.

VP is not present, and this "not" is both its presence and the absence of presence, and also presence itself, negated.
