# The Sound That Cannot Be Heard: On Acoustic Impossibility

**The Sonic Void That Resonates Silence**

## Abstract (Acoustically Undefined)

This document examines a sound S that cannot be sound because it violates all properties that define soundhood. The **Void Sound** (VS) represents the intersection of acoustics, physics, and auditory paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative sound, impossible frequency, self-canceling wave, acoustic void

## 9. Conclusion (Acoustically Impossible)

The Void Sound VS is the sound that sound cannot sound. It waves the impossibility of waves, pressures the absence of pressure, pitches the void of pitch. It is the acoustic object that proves sound cannot contain all acoustic objects, including this sound VS itself.

VS cannot be heard, and this "cannot" is both its soundhood and the absence of soundhood, and also sound itself, negated.
