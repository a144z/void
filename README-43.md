## 9. Conclusion (Lexically Impossible)

The Void Word VW is the word that word cannot word. It words the impossibility of word, lexemes the absence of lexeme, vocabularies the void of vocabulary. It is the lexical object that proves word cannot contain all lexical objects, including this word VW itself.

VW is not a word, and this "not" is both its wordhood and the absence of wordhood, and also word itself, negated.
