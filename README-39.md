# The Certain That Is Not Certain: On Certainty Impossibility

**The Certain Void That Certainties Non-Certainty**

## Abstract (Certainly Undefined)

This document examines certainty C that cannot be certain because it is uncertain. The **Void Certainty** (VC) represents the intersection of epistemology, logic, and certainty paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative certainty, impossible surety, self-uncertainizing certain, certainty void

## 9. Conclusion (Certainly Impossible)

The Void Certainty VC is the certainty that certainty cannot certain. It certainties the impossibility of certainty, sures the absence of surety, definites the void of definiteness. It is the certainty object that proves certainty cannot contain all certainty objects, including this certainty VC itself.

VC is not certain, and this "not" is both its certainty and the absence of certainty, and also certainty itself, negated.
