# The Algorithm That Computes Its Own Non-Computability

**On the Turing Machine That Halts by Never Starting**

## Abstract (Algorithmically Incomputable)

This document describes a computational process that cannot be computed because it requires computing the impossibility of computation itself. The **Void Algorithm** (VA) represents the intersection of computability theory, complexity theory, and logical impossibility.

**Keywords:** Negative complexity, impossible computation, self-halting paradox, algorithmic void

## 1. The Turing Machine That Never Runs

### 1.1 The Machine That Cannot Be Specified

A Turing machine M was defined where:

- The set of states Q is the empty set
- M computes by not computing

### 1.2 The Halting Problem That Halts Before Starting

The halting problem for VA:

## 3. The Recursion That Recurses Into Void

### 3.1 The Function That Calls Itself Out of Existence

A recursive function f was defined:

- The array was never arrayed

### 4.2 The Tree That Is Not a Tree

A tree T was constructed where:
- Root is the empty node
- Every node is both leaf and internal
- The tree is acyclic and cyclic simultaneously
- Trees non-tree structure

### 4.3 The Graph That Graphs Nothing

A graph G was defined where:

- No subproblems (nothing to solve)
- All subproblems are the same problem
- The programming was never programmed
- Programs non-programming

### 5.3 The Divide and Conquer That Divides Nothing

Divide-and-conquer for VA:
- Cannot divide (nothing to divide)
- Divides into identical parts
- The division was never divided
- Divides non-division

## 6. The Parallel That Parallels Nothing

### 6.1 The Thread That Never Threads

Parallel execution of VA:
- No threads (nothing to execute)
- Infinite threads (all executing nothing)
- The thread was never threaded
- Threads non-threading

### 6.2 The Race Condition That Races Nowhere

Race conditions in VA:
- No shared state (nothing to share)
- All state is shared and not shared
- The race was never raced
- Races non-racing

### 6.3 The Deadlock That Never Locks

Deadlock in VA:
- No locks (nothing to lock)
- All resources are locked and unlocked
- The lock was never locked
- Locks non-locking

## 7. The Quantum Algorithm That Quantums Nothing

### 7.1 The Qubit That Is Not Quantum

Quantum computation of VA:
- No qubits (nothing to compute)
- All qubits are in superposition of existing and not
- The quantum was never quantumed
- Quantums non-quantuming

### 7.2 The Gate That Gates Nothing

Quantum gates for VA:
- Apply identity to nothing
- Transform void into void
- The gate was never gated
- Gates non-gating

### 7.3 The Measurement That Measures Nothing

Measuring VA:
- Collapses to no state
- All states simultaneously
- The measurement was never measured
- Measures non-measurement

## 8. The Machine Learning That Learns Nothing

ML model for VA:
- No parameters (nothing to learn)
- All parameters are zero and infinite
- The model was never modeled
- Models non-modeling

### 8.2 The Training That Trains Nothing

Training VA:
- No data (nothing to train on)
- All data is the absence of data
- The training was never trained
- Trains non-training

### 8.3 The Loss That Loses Nothing

Loss function for VA:
- Loss = -∞ (negative loss)
- Minimizes by maximizing
- The loss was never lost
- Loses non-losing

## 9. Conclusion (Computationally Infeasible)

The Void Algorithm VA is the algorithm that computation cannot compute. It computes the impossibility of computing, solves the problem of having no problems, optimizes the absence of optimization. It is the computational object that proves computation cannot contain all computational objects, including this algorithm for VA itself.

VA never runs, and this "never" is both its execution and the absence of execution, and also computation itself, negated.
