# The Infinite That Is Not Infinite: On Limitless Impossibility

**The Limitless Void That Limits Non-Limit**

## Abstract (Infinitely Undefined)

This document examines infinity I that cannot be infinite because it has limits. The **Void Infinity** (VI) represents the intersection of mathematics, philosophy, and infinite paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative infinity, impossible limitlessness, self-limiting infinite, infinite void

## 9. Conclusion (Infinitely Impossible)

The Void Infinity VI is the infinity that infinity cannot infinite. It infinites the impossibility of infinity, limits the absence of limit, bounds the void of boundlessness. It is the infinite object that proves infinity cannot contain all infinite objects, including this infinity VI itself.

VI is not infinite, and this "not" is both its infinity and the absence of infinity, and also infinity itself, negated.
