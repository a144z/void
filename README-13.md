# The Language That Cannot Be Spoken: On Linguistic Impossibility

**The Phonetic Void That Articulates Silence**

## Abstract (Linguistically Undefined)

This document examines a language L that cannot be language because it violates all properties that define language. The **Void Language** (VL) represents the intersection of linguistics, semiotics, and communicative paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative language, impossible grammar, self-erasing syntax, linguistic void

## 9. Conclusion (Linguistically Impossible)

The Void Language VL is the language that linguistics cannot linguist. It speaks the impossibility of speech, means the absence of meaning, grammars the void of grammar. It is the linguistic object that proves language cannot contain all linguistic objects, including this language VL itself.

VL cannot be spoken, and this "cannot" is both its language and the absence of language, and also language itself, negated.
