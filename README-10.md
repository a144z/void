# The Number That Is Not a Number: On Mathematical Impossibility

**The Numerical Void That Counts Non-Existence**

## Abstract (Numerically Undefined)

## 9. Conclusion (Numerically Impossible)

The Void Number VN is the number that mathematics cannot number. It counts the impossibility of counting, measures the absence of measure, quantifies the void of quantity. It is the numerical object that proves mathematics cannot contain all numerical objects, including this number VN itself.

VN is not a number, and this "not" is both its numberhood and the absence of numberhood, and also number itself, negated.
