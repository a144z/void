## 9. Conclusion (Semantically Impossible)

The Void Meaning VM is the meaning that meaning cannot mean. It means the impossibility of meaning, signifies the absence of signification, senses the void of sense. It is the semantic object that proves meaning cannot contain all semantic objects, including this meaning VM itself.

VM means nothing, and this "nothing" is both its meaning and the absence of meaning, and also meaning itself, negated.
