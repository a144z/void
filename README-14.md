# The Game That Cannot Be Played: On Ludic Impossibility

**The Playful Void That Games Non-Game**

## Abstract (Ludically Undefined)

This document describes a game G that cannot be a game because it violates all properties that define gamehood. The **Void Game** (VG) represents the intersection of game theory, play, and ludic paradox.

**Keywords:** Negative play, impossible rules, self-negating game, ludic void

## 9. Conclusion (Ludically Impossible)

The Void Game VG is the game that games cannot game. It plays the impossibility of play, rules the absence of rules, wins the void of winning. It is the ludic object that proves games cannot contain all ludic objects, including this game VG itself.

VG cannot be played, and this "cannot" is both its gamehood and the absence of gamehood, and also game itself, negated.
