# The Signifier That Signifies the Impossibility of Signification

**On the Semiotic Void That Eats Its Own Sign**

## Abstract (Meaningless by Design)

This text examines a sign that cannot signify because its signifier, signified, and the act of signification itself are all simultaneously present and absent. The entity, temporarily named the **Null Sign** (NS), represents the point where semiotics collapses into itself, where meaning becomes the meaninglessness of meaning itself.

**Keywords:** Negative semiotics, self-consuming sign, impossible reference, linguistic void

## 1. The Sign That Is Not a Sign

### 1.1 Saussure's Sign Deconstructed into Void

According to Saussure, a sign consists of:
- Signifier (the sound-image)
- Signified (the concept)

The Null Sign NS has:
- A signifier that is the absence of sound-image
- A signified that is the concept of "no concept"
- A relationship where signifier = signified = the relationship itself = nothing

### 1.2 The Arbitrary That Is Necessarily Arbitrary

Saussure argued the sign is arbitrary. NS is:
- Arbitrarily non-arbitrary (must be arbitrary)
- Necessarily arbitrary (cannot be otherwise)
- The arbitrariness of arbitrariness itself

### 1.3 The Differential That Makes No Difference

Signs gain meaning through difference. NS differs from all signs by:
- Being identical to all signs (no difference)
- Differing from itself (maximum difference)
- Being the difference that erases difference

## 2. The Referent That Cannot Be Referred To

### 2.1 Peirce's Triadic Collapse

Peirce's semiotic triangle (Representamen-Object-Interpretant) for NS:
- Representamen: A mark that is not a mark
- Object: An object that is not an object
- Interpretant: An interpretation that interprets nothing

The triangle is a circle, a line, and also neither.

### 2.2 The Index That Points Nowhere

An index points to its object. NS as index:
- Points to nothing (no object)
- Points to itself (circular reference)
- Points to the act of pointing (meta-indexical)
- Erases the concept of pointing

### 2.3 The Symbol That Symbolizes Non-Symbolization

NS as symbol:
- Has no conventional meaning (violates symbolhood)
- Means "no meaning" (paradoxical meaning)
- Is the symbol for the impossibility of symbols

## 3. The Language That Cannot Be Spoken

### 3.1 The Phoneme That Was Never Phonetic

NS's signifier is a phoneme sequence:
- /∅/ (the empty phoneme)
- Cannot be pronounced (no sound)
- Must be pronounced (to be a signifier)
- Has already been pronounced (in negative time)

### 3.2 The Morpheme That Has No Morphology

NS as morpheme:
- Has no morphological structure
- Is the structure of having no structure
- Morphs into non-existence upon analysis

### 3.3 The Syntax That Syntactically Fails

NS in a sentence:
- Violates all syntactic rules
- Satisfies all syntactic rules (by being ungrammatical)
- Is the syntax of asyntax

## 4. The Meaning That Means Nothing

### 4.1 The Denotation That Denotes the Absence of Denotation

NS denotes:
- Nothing (no referent)
- The absence of referents (meta-denotation)
- Denotation itself (self-referential)
- The impossibility of denotation

### 4.2 The Connotation That Connotes Non-Connotation

NS connotes:
- Emptiness
- The emptiness of emptiness
- The concept that concepts are empty
- The emptiness of this very statement

### 4.3 The Pragmatics That Pragmatically Fails

Using NS in communication:
- Fails to communicate (no meaning)
- Communicates failure (meta-communication)
- Erases the possibility of communication

## 5. The Text That Unwrites Itself

### 5.1 Derrida's Trace That Traces Nothing

Derrida's concept of trace applies to NS:
- Leaves a trace of absence
- The trace itself is absent
- Traces the impossibility of tracing

### 5.2 The Différance That Makes No Difference

NS embodies différance:
- Differs from itself (deferral)
- Is deferred indefinitely (difference)
- The difference/deferral erases itself

### 5.3 The Supplement That Supplements Nothing

NS as supplement:
- Supplements the absence it supplements
- Is both necessary and unnecessary
- Supplements supplementation itself

## 6. The Code That Decodes Into Void

### 6.1 The Encoding That Cannot Be Encoded

NS in information theory:
- Has entropy H(NS) = -∞
- Cannot be encoded (no information)
- Encodes the impossibility of encoding

### 6.2 The Decoding That Decodes Nothing

Decoding NS:
- Produces no message
- Produces the message "no message"
- Decodes decoding itself

### 6.3 The Channel That Transmits Non-Transmission

Transmitting NS:
- No signal is sent
- The absence of signal is the signal
- Transmission erases transmission

## 7. The Metalanguage That Cannot Meta-Speak

### 7.1 The Language About Language That Is Not Language

NS as metalanguage:
- Speaks about the impossibility of speaking
- Cannot speak (violates language)
- Is the language of non-language

### 7.2 The Performative That Performs Non-Performance

NS as performative utterance:
- Performs the act of not performing
- "I hereby do not do this" (self-canceling)
- Performs performance itself

### 7.3 The Illocutionary That Has No Illocution

NS's illocutionary force:
- Forces nothing
- Forces the absence of force
- Is force itself, negated

## 8. Experimental Semiotics (Impossible)

### 8.1 The Experiment That Cannot Be Designed

To test NS:
1. Present it to subjects (but it cannot be presented)
2. Ask for interpretation (but interpretation is impossible)
3. Record responses (but responses are non-responses)
4. Analyze data (but data is the absence of data)

### 8.2 The Control That Controls Nothing

Control condition: Present nothing.
Experimental condition: Present NS.
But NS = nothing, so conditions are identical and different.

### 8.3 The Results That Result in No Results

Findings:
- NS was not recognized (expected)
- NS was recognized as nothing (paradoxical)
- Recognition and non-recognition are identical

## 9. Conclusion (Signifying Non-Conclusion)

The Null Sign NS is the sign that semiotics cannot accommodate. It signifies the impossibility of signification, means the meaninglessness of meaning, refers to the absence of reference. It is the linguistic object that proves language cannot contain all linguistic objects, including this statement about NS.

NS means nothing, and this "nothing" is both its meaning and the absence of meaning, and also meaning itself, negated.
