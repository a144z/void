## 9. Conclusion (Ontologically Impossible)

The Void Existence VE is the existence that existence cannot exist. It exists the impossibility of existence, beings the absence of being, ontologizes the void of ontology. It is the ontological object that proves existence cannot contain all ontological objects, including this existence VE itself.

VE does not exist, and this "not" is both its existence and the absence of existence, and also existence itself, negated.
